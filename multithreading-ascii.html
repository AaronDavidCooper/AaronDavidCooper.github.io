                                    <br><br>
                                    One of the issues I encountered during my previous project, was the time it took to process high resolution images. I made a work-around on the last project by downscaling the images before processing it, but I knew this could be improved by implementing multi-threading.
                                    <br><br>
                                    So first of all, I reviewed my code and was able to improve it by populating all of the arrays within one loop, rather than two as previous, which helped speed it up slightly. I then had to decide how I was going to do distibute the workload to each worker and settled on the below solution. As you can see, I pass the array through to each worker, providing them each with a equal but unique chunk/section to process. The only exception being the last worker, who also processes the remaining indexes that couldn't be split out. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <img src="assets/images/workerPayloadDistribution.png">                    
                                    <br>
                                    Each worker is also given a unique ID (which comes in handy later!) and a couple other parameters required to complete their task, which in case you didn't watch the previous video, are the following;<br>
                                    ■ Arraylist of brightness value of each pixel<br>
                                    ■ Arraylist of hex color of each pixel<br>
                                    ■ Arraylist of ASCII representation of each pixel (ie. ;Il!i~+_$#)<br>
                                    <br> 
                                    I decided to have the Worker class implement Callable&lt;V&gt; so that I could return a value. The value needed to contain all 3 arrays, so I could've passed an array of arrays but I also needed to know <i>which</i> array was which. So I settled on using a Map&lt;String, List&lt;Object&gt;&gt; so I could give each key to identify them later.<br><br>
                                    <img src="assets/images/workerTask.png">
                                    <br>
                                    So once all of the above work has been completed, I'm left with 10 (that's how many workers/threads I chose) Map's all containing a section of the original array, processed into 3 Lists. So now I was left with the task of combining these Lists togethor, in the correct order, so that I could use this data as intended. This is where the unique ID that I gave each worker earlier comes in handy, as well as the 'key' I had given in the Map to represent each List. 
                                    <br><br><img src="assets/images/rebuildingWorkersData.png">
                                    <br>
                        Overall I am happy with the results, as you may have seen on the overview, I was able to reduce the processing time from <b>24 seconds</b> down to <b>under 10 seconds!</b> The image in question was 7.86MB large, dimensions of 4524x3016 with 300dpi.

                    </p>
